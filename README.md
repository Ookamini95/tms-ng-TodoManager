# Todo Management System - Angular Project

## Overview
The **Todo Management System** is a task management application built with Angular. This app allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, manage task statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done), and filter or sort tasks efficiently. The UI leverages **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI** for styling, and **JSON Server** simulates the backend API for task management operations.


### Features:
- **Task Management**: Users can view a list of tasks with attributes such as Title, Description, and Status.
- **Task Operations**: Users can create new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete tasks from the list.
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Basic filtering and sorting options are available for users to manage their task list.
- **Fake API Integration**: The app calls a fake API (using JSON Server) to get task data and simulates network delays for loading with a skeleton loader.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Allows users to drag tasks between different statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Task Dashboard**: A simple dashboard that shows statistics like the number of tasks in each status.
- **Responsive UI**: The interface is responsive and optimized for large and small devices, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
